/**
 * F3, because the bar, the field that grows in it and the address only exist in
 * a browser: the `+` is reached by a tap on a 480px screen and by a mouse on a
 * 1280px one, and landing on a dashboard by its own address is real navigation.
 *
 * It is not re-proving the naming rules, which
 * apps/api/tests/integration/http/dashboards.test.ts owns against a real store,
 * nor which view a workspace opens on, which
 * apps/web/tests/unit/router.test.tsx owns. This is the one walk that says the
 * capability works for a person.
 *
 * It adds its dashboard to a workspace it makes, not to a seeded one: every
 * spec in a run shares one database (support/app.ts), so a walk that filled
 * Work's bar would leave it filled for whatever ran next.
